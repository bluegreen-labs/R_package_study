## Abstract

Here, I document the overall longevity and continued maintenance of the totality of R 
packages published in the journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution, a mainstay for 
methodological work and R packages in ecology. I conclude that published packages are well 
maintained, and remain viable long after the average PhD or postdoc appointments. 
However, (survival) bias and privilege of the authors should be further explored with an in 
depth survey on career paths.
